# SA-1 Root: Gradius III
Version 1.6, released 2021-04-04

Gradius 3 is a classic shooting game made by Konami.

This SA-1 Root reduces most of the orignal game's slowdown and lag and minimizes
the overall loading time. As a side effect, the game is now much more difficult.

## Base and Origin versions

There is two versions available. One is the base SA-1 Root patch, where it
activates the SA-1 chip and accelerates the game to the maximum. The BPS files
are Gradius-III-JPN.bps and Gradius-III-USA.bps

Another version uses GuyPerfect's spdwn add-on that reduces the speeds of most
of the Gradius III bosses, making it closer to the original game speed, but still
without slowdown being used. The BPS files are Gradius-III-Origin-JPN.bps and
Gradius-III-Origin-USA.bps

## How to Patch

Download the latest Gradius III .bps patch file available on the
[Releases](https://github.com/VitorVilela7/SA1-Root/releases) tab.

You can patch it using [beat](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/)
or [FLIPS](https://sneslab.net/tools/floating.zip), both common .bps patchers.

You can also patch the .asm files directly using
[Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar).

It works with both American and Japanese version of Gradius III.

## Technical details

* Remapping mode: Full
* Remapping strategy: Runtime
* SA-1 usage: Aggressive

This game has a very complex data structure.
Direct page, indirect addressing and shared ROM/RAM pointers are
pretty common on this game. For that, I had to remap the entire RAM memory
to the BW-RAM and for the data structures that referenced banks 7E/7F were
most of the time remapped by runtime for not having to mine over 450KB
of data structures.

SA-1 was used for the maximum time possible and a callback system was used
for the SA-1 CPU calling back the SNES CPU when running on routines that
it can't handle (APU uploads and PPU updates mostly).

Because of the strategy used,
**128 kB (1024 Kbit) of BW-RAM is required to the game run** correctly.

## RAM remap

* ``$0000-$1FFF`` -> ``$6000-$7FFF``
* ``$7E:0000-$7F:FFFF`` -> ``$40:0000-$41:FFFF``
